# Changelog

All notable changes to GSD will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Shell hooks falsely flagged as stale on every session** — `gsd-phase-boundary.sh`, `gsd-session-state.sh`, and `gsd-validate-commit.sh` now ship with a `# gsd-hook-version: {{GSD_VERSION}}` header; the installer substitutes `{{GSD_VERSION}}` in `.sh` hooks the same way it does for `.js` hooks; and the stale-hook detector in `gsd-check-update.js` now matches bash `#` comment syntax in addition to JS `//` syntax. All three changes are required together — neither the regex fix alone nor the install fix alone is sufficient to resolve the false positive (#2136, #2206, #2209, #2210, #2212)

## [1.35.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Cline runtime support** — First-class Cline runtime via rules-based integration. Installs to `~/.cline/` or `./.cline/` as `.clinerules`. No custom slash commands — uses rules. `--cline` flag. (#1605 follow-up)
- **CodeBuddy runtime support** — Skills-based install to `~/.codebuddy/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`. `--codebuddy` flag.
- **Qwen Code runtime support** — Skills-based install to `~/.qwen/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, same open standard as Claude Code 2.1.88+. `QWEN_CONFIG_DIR` env var for custom paths. `--qwen` flag.
- **`/gsd-from-gsd2` command** (`gsd:from-gsd2`) — Reverse migration from GSD-2 format (`.gsd/` with Milestone→Slice→Task hierarchy) back to v1 `.planning/` format. Flags: `--dry-run` (preview only), `--force` (overwrite existing `.planning/`), `--path <dir>` (specify GSD-2 root). Produces `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, and sequential phase dirs. Flattens Milestone→Slice hierarchy to sequential phase numbers (M001/S01→phase 01, M001/S02→phase 02, M002/S01→phase 03, etc.).
- **`/gsd-ai-integration-phase` command** (`gsd:ai-integration-phase`) — AI framework selection wizard for integrating AI/LLM capabilities into a project phase. Interactive decision matrix with domain-specific failure modes and eval criteria. Produces `AI-SPEC.md` with framework recommendation, implementation guidance, and evaluation strategy. Runs 3 parallel specialist agents: domain-researcher, framework-selector, ai-researcher, eval-planner.
- **`/gsd-eval-review` command** (`gsd:eval-review`) — Retroactive audit of an implemented AI phase's evaluation coverage. Checks implementation against `AI-SPEC.md` evaluation plan. Scores each eval dimension as COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING. Produces `EVAL-REVIEW.md` with findings, gaps, and remediation guidance.
- **Review model configuration** — Per-CLI model selection for /gsd-review via `review.models.<cli>` config keys. Falls back to CLI defaults when not set. (#1849)
- **Statusline now surfaces GSD milestone/phase/status** — when no `in_progress` todo is active, `gsd-statusline.js` reads `.planning/STATE.md` (walking up from the workspace dir) and fills the middle slot with `<milestone> · <status> · <phase> (N/total)`. Gracefully degrades when fields are missing; identical to previous behavior when there is no STATE.md or an active todo wins the slot. Uses the YAML frontmatter added for #628.
- **Qwen Code and Cursor CLI peer reviewers** — Added as reviewers in `/gsd-review` with `--qwen` and `--cursor` flags. (#1966)

### Changed
- **Worktree safety — `git clean` prohibition** — `gsd-executor` now prohibits `git clean` in worktree context to prevent deletion of prior wave output. (#2075)
- **Executor deletion verification** — Pre-merge deletion checks added to catch missing artifacts before executor commit. (#2070)
- **Hard reset in worktree branch check** — `--hard` flag in `worktree_branch_check` now correctly resets the file tree, not just HEAD. (#2073)

### Fixed
- **Context7 MCP CLI fallback** — Handles `tools: []` response that previously broke Context7 availability detection. (#1885)
- **`Agent` tool in gsd-autonomous** — Added `Agent` to `allowed-tools` to unblock subagent spawning. (#2043)
- **`intel.enabled` in config-set whitelist** — Config key now accepted by `config-set` without validation error. (#2021)
- **`writeSettings` null guard** — Guards against null `settingsPath` for Cline runtime to prevent crash on install. (#2046)
- **Shell hook absolute paths** — `.sh` hooks now receive absolute quoted paths in `buildHookCommand`, fixing path resolution in non-standard working directories. (#2045)
- **`processAttribution` runtime-aware** — Was hardcoded to `'claude'`; now reads actual runtime from environment.
- **`AskUserQuestion` plain-text fallback** — Non-Claude runtimes now receive plain-text numbered lists instead of broken TUI menus.
- **iOS app scaffold uses XcodeGen** — Prevents SPM execution errors in generated iOS scaffolds. (#2023)
- **`acceptance_criteria` hard gate** — Enforced as a hard gate in executor — plans missing acceptance criteria are rejected before execution begins. (#1958)
- **`normalizePhaseName` preserves letter suffix case** — Phase names with letter suffixes (e.g., `1a`, `2B`) now preserve original case. (#1963)

## [1.34.2] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Node.js minimum lowered to 22** — `engines.node` was raised to `>=24.0.0` based on a CI matrix change, but Node 22 is still in Active LTS until October 2026. Restoring Node 22 support eliminates the `EBADENGINE` warning for users on the previous LTS line. CI matrix now tests against both Node 22 and Node 24.

## [1.34.1] - 2026-04-06

- **Execution context profiles** — Three context profiles (`dev`, `research`, `review`) for mode-specific agent output guidance (#1807)

### Fixed
- **Shell hooks missing from npm package** — `hooks/*.sh` files excluded from tarball due to `hooks/dist` allowlist; changed to `hooks` (#1852 #1862)
- **detectConfigDir priority** — `.claude` now searched first so Claude Code users don't see false update warnings when multiple runtimes are installed (#1860)
- **Milestone backlog preservation** — `phases clear` no longer wipes 999.x backlog phases (#1858)

## [1.33.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Queryable codebase intelligence system** -- Persistent `.planning/intel/` store with structured JSON files (files, exports, symbols, patterns, dependencies).

## [1.26.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Developer profiling pipeline** — `/gsd:profile-user` analyzes Claude Code session history to build behavioral profiles across 8 dimensions (communication, decisions, debugging, UX, vendor choices, frustrations, learning style, explanation depth). Generates `USER-PROFILE.md`, `/gsd:dev-preferences`, and `CLAUDE.md` profile section. Includes `--questionnaire` fallback and `--refresh` for re-analysis (#1084)

- **Markdown normalization** — Generated markdown conforms to markdownlint standards (#1112)
- **`/gsd:audit-uat` command** — Cross-phase audit of all outstanding UAT and verification items. Scans every phase for pending, skipped, blocked, and human_needed items. Cross-references against codebase to detect stale documentation. Produces prioritized human test plan grouped by testability
- **Verification debt tracking** — Five structural improvements to prevent silent loss of UAT/verification items when projects advance:
  - Cross-phase health check in `/gsd:progress` (Step 1.6) surfaces outstanding items from ALL prior phases
  - `status: partial` in UAT files distinguishes incomplete testing from completed sessions
  - `result: blocked` with `blocked_by` tag for tests blocked by external dependencies (server, device, build, third-party)
  - `human_needed` verification items now persist as HUMAN-UAT.md files (trackable across sessions)
  - Phase completion and transition warnings surface verification debt non-blockingly
- **Advisor mode for discuss-phase** — Spawns parallel research agents during `/gsd:discuss-phase` to evaluate gray areas before user decides. Returns structured comparison tables calibrated to user's vendor philosophy. Activates only when `USER-PROFILE.md` exists (#1211)

## [1.22.3] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Verify-work auto-injects a cold-start smoke test for phases that modify server, database, seed, or startup files — catches warm-state blind spots

### Changed
- Renamed `depth` setting to `granularity` with values `coarse`/`standard`/`fine` to accurately reflect what it controls (phase count, not investigation depth). Backward-compatible migration auto-renames existing config.

- Explicit scope guardrail prevents scope creep during discussion — captures deferred ideas without acting on them
- CONTEXT.md template restructured for decisions (domain boundary, decisions by category, Claude's discretion, deferred ideas)
- Downstream awareness: discuss-phase now explicitly documents that CONTEXT.md feeds researcher and planner agents
- `/gsd:plan-phase` now integrates research — spawns `gsd-phase-researcher` before planning unless research exists or `--skip-research` flag used

  - `discuss-milestone` is now required before `new-milestone` (creates context file)
  - `research-project` is milestone-aware — focuses on new features, ignores already-validated requirements
  - `create-roadmap` continues phase numbering from previous milestone
  - Flow: complete → discuss → new-milestone → research → requirements → roadmap

### Fixed

### Changed
- `gsd-executor` subagent color changed from red to blue

## [1.5.7] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- `gsd-executor` subagent: Dedicated agent for plan execution with full workflow logic built-in

## [1.5.6] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README: Separated flow into distinct steps (1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) making `research-project` clearly optional and `define-requirements` required

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **execute-phase narration**: Orchestrator now describes what each wave builds before spawning agents, and summarizes what was built after completion. No more staring at opaque status updates.
- **new-project flow**: Now offers two paths — research first (recommended) or define requirements directly (fast path for familiar domains)
- **define-requirements**: Works without prior research. Gathers requirements through conversation when FEATURES.md doesn't exist.

### Removed
- Dead `/gsd:status` command (referenced abandoned background agent model)
- Unused `agent-history.md` template

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Research agents write their own files directly (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) instead of returning results to orchestrator
- Slimmed principles.md and load it dynamically in core commands

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/gsd:research-project` command for pre-roadmap ecosystem research — spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls before you commit to a roadmap
- New `/gsd:define-requirements` command for scoping v1 requirements from research findings — transforms "what exists in this domain" into "what we're building"
- Requirements traceability: phases now map to specific requirement IDs with 100% coverage validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** New project flow is now: `new-project → research-project → define-requirements → create-roadmap`
- Roadmap creation now requires REQUIREMENTS.md and validates all v1 requirements are mapped to phases
- Simplified questioning in new-project to four essentials (vision, core priority, boundaries, constraints)
